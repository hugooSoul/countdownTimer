# Countdown Timer


In **coinFlip** directory there is a JS file with a randomNumber function,
this function just accept a number greater or equal than 1 and less than 1,000,000,
and return a random number.

**countdownTimerJS** has the files for the countdown using only Javascript.

**countdownTimerVue** has the files for the countdown using VueJS,
I'm learning Vue yet, I'm not really good with it.
